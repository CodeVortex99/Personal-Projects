Collections: 
    -> single variable used to store multiple values.
    -> Iterable using for loops to access individua items/elements.

    -> To know the properties of something:
        -> Either User dir(collection/variable/function) or 
            help(collection/variable/function) function
        -> Then it needs to be printed.


    List:

        -> [] ordered and changeable.
        -> Duplicates are allowed.

        -> To access a certain element:
            -> Use the Index Operator
            -> variable[index]
                -> Index starts from 0.
            
            "If the index is out of lists' range:
                -> Error:
                    -> IndexError: list index out of range

            variable[:index] -> can be used to print every element up to the 
                certain index.

            Steps:
                variable[::n] -> can be used to access every nth element from the
                    0 index.

                variable[::-n] -> can be used to reverse the list.

            -> len() can be used to find the length of the collection/list.

            -> We can find if a value is within the collection through the use
                of 'in' function.
                -> For Example: print("element" in variable of collection)
                    -> will output a boolean which can be either used for validation
                         or iteration purposes.
                -> This applies to Sets and Tuples

            -> An element in a list can be changed:
                -> variable[index] = "Changed to the item"

            -> You can append an item to your list through:
                -> name_of_the_list.append("Changed to the item")

            -> You can remove an item from the list through the use of:
                -> variable.remove("Item")

            -> To insert an item to the front of the list:
                -> variable.insert(index, "item")

            -> You can sort a list through the use of:
                -> variable.sort()

            -> You can reverse the list through the use of:
                -> variable.reverse()

            -> You can clear the list through the use of:
                -> variable.clear()

            -> To print the index of an element
                -> print(variable.index("Element/item))
                -> to find the index of an item not in the list:
                    ValueError: 'item' not in the list

            -> to find the number of items in a list:
                -> print(variable.count("item"))
            

    Set:

        -> {} unordered and immutable, but ADD/Remove OK.
        -> Duplicates not allowed.

        -> You can't find the indexed element of a set as it is unordered.

        -> To add an item/element: variable.add("item")
        -> To remove an element: variable.remove("item")
        -> To remove the first element: variable.pop()
            -> It is always going to be random as a set is unordered.

        -> To clear the set: variable.clear()

    Tuples:

        -> () Ordered and unchangeable.
        -> Duplicates allows.
        -> Faster than lists when its properties are required which are mentioned above.

        -> Made up of parentheses

        -> To find the index of an item:
            -> print(variable.index("item"))

        -> To Count an item:
            -> print(variable.count("item"))

    Dictionaries:

        -> A collection of {key:value} pairs ordered and changeable
        -> No Duplicates

        -> Each key-value pair needs to be seperated by a comma
        
        -> variable.get("key") can be used to access the value of the key.
            -> It can either be printed or used within conditional statements for validation.

        -> using variable.update({"key": "value"})
            -> new key-value pair can be added to the dictionary.
            -> the existing key-value pair can also be changed/updated

        -> variable.pop("key")
            -> can be used to remove a key-value pair from the dictionary.
            -> variable.popitem() will remove the latest key-value pair/item from the dictionary

        -> variable.clear() will remove every key-value pair from the dictionary.

        -> variable.keys() can be used to get a list of object of all the keys
            in the dictionary without their values.

        -> variable.values() can be used to get a list of object of all the values
            in the dictionary without their keys.

            -> it is better to assign the variable.keys() or variable.values() to a variable
                and then printing the variable.

        -> Dictionaries are iterable so, you can print out each seperate key/value 
            using a for loop.

        -> variable.items() can be used to resemble a dictionary object
            out a 2D list of tuples.
            
            -> Furthermore, FOR Loop can be used again to lay out the 
                dictionary in a visually pleasing method, for example:

                -> for key, value in variable.items():
                        print(f"{key}: {value}")

If I want to check if any of the elements in a certain list is in the Input:
    -> if any(item in list for item in Input): ...
